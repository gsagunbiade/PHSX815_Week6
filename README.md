These Python files

Trap.py 

MC_integral.py

can be run from the Command/Terminal line by typing:

<> python Trap.py

<> MC_integral.py


This requires a working Python distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python packages numpy, sympy, scipy.integrate and Matplotlib also installed.
